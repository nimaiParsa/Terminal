NAME
       mygrep - print lines that match pattern

SYNOPSIS
       mygrep [OPTION] PATTERN [FILE...]

NOTE BY THE AUTHOR
       FILE must not be a directory.
       The PATTERN must not start with a '-'.
       The PATTERN must be a single word (not containing any newline characters
       or spaces).
       The PATTERN may be enclosed in quotes.
       Only Single Options are valid.	

DESCRIPTION
       mygrep  searches  for  PATTERN  in  each  FILE, and  mygrep prints  each
       line that matches the pattern.

OPTIONS
       -v,
             Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
       
       -i,
             Ignore  case  distinctions  in  patterns and  input data, so that
             characters that differ only in case match each other.

       -n,
             Prefix each line of output with the  1-based line  number  within
             its input file.

       -c,
             Suppress  normal output; instead print a count of matching  lines
             for each input file.
